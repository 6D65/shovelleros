#The Shovellers Game

## The Idea

## Getting started

The game is basend on the [Cocos2d-x game engine](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/), more specifically the JavaScript
version of it, which is called cocos2d-js. 


## The Vagrant Image

Ideally this will work by cd'ing into the vagrantimage folder. Then calling:


```bash
vagrant up
```

The script by itself will install all the prerequisites for the cocos2d-x and cocos2d-js, including the android sdk/ndk.
**Note:** not done yet.

## Installing the cocos2d-x/js on Linux

## Adding GLEW cmake to make the build work
